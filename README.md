# CS120: Final Project
## Team Members:
 - Ty Allembert
 - Nate Lalor
 - Aiden McCormack

## Project Summary:
We created an enriching dessert-themed game which we modeled after tower defense, Mario, and Fortnite. 

Commit Disclaimer: It has come to our attention that the TAs do look into number of commits per contributor. We must make you aware, we used the Code With Me function on CLion for this project. What this means, is we were able to all code together using one person's code as a host. Thus, when that one host commits, it is all of our work together. With that being said, please do not be alarmed if the commits are uneven between the 3 contributors, because we worked hard to equally contribute throughout the coding process. 

## Concept Description:
Combining all the previous modules, we were able to build upon a semester of learning to produce an engaging and interactive game that provides the user with long-lasting fun! We worked off a foundation of many concepts, including everything from inheritance & polymorphism in module 2, to the drawing and timers providing graphics from module 4. We outline further within the code, but as a whole we worked hard to efficiently integrate many aspects from throughout the class into our final product. 

## Operating Systems:
We have designed the gaming using simple graphics via C++. That being said, it is combatible for many different operating systems.

## Necessary Installations:
There are no necessary installations required. To reiderate, everything is via C++.

## Citations:
All the code is ours, besides the general shape classes that Lisa used throughout Module 4. This includes the shape class, rect class, circle class, and quad class, which you can find here: https://github.com/uvmcs120s2022/M4GP-Runner and https://github.com/uvmcs120s2022/Graphics-Jeopardy.

## Grade:
Let's break down our grade together, going off of the rubric:

- Design -- 20:


This class gave us a significant chunk of class time for this assignment. And hopefully as you can tell from our product, we have not wasted a second. With a big project, we emphasized thinking through exactly what we wanted to create and how we wanted to create it. That being said, our followthrough to meet all requirements and have them seamlessly integrated within our program was done very efficiently. We hope it shows that we worked hard not only to satisfy the requirements, but so do in a way that also produced a fun and engaging game.

- Execution -- 40:


With a ton of moving parts and files all working together, it was paramount to have good style and well documentation throughout our project. Especially when collaborating, we needed to have clear communication in terms of what things did and where. In that regard, we think we performed very well.

The one aspect we struggle to bring to the table was the testing file. In order to feel confident in our game as the final product, we chose to prioritize other developments instead of a testing file. Yes, this can be seen as a big deal. However, to the regard of execution as a whole, we feel outside of this testing file we did exceptionally well satisfying every other requirement while also producing clear and efficient code.

- Usability -- 20:


We worked hard for many, many days and nights to provide our users with an elegant and seamless game. This meant combinging timers to improve FPS, as well as making sure we deal with our objects sufficiently. We went above and beyond to ensure the best experience in terms of usability, but also in terms of it being an interesting and enjoyable. 

- Complexity -- 50:


With such a nice timeframe for the project, we were able to work hard as well as have fun implementing dozens of aspects to heighten user experience as well as test our knowledge. That being said, our project goes above and beyond to ensure that as a final project, as well as a 3-way developer collaboration, we provide the cutting edge functionality through advanced programming that exceeds what CS120 has to offer. With high expectations, we worked hard to deliver an elaborate, complex, and immense program that also was a lot of fun.


- Conclusion -- 130:


To conclude, we hope we made it clear how hard we worked to provide such a fun and fine product. Through the different topics outlined in the rubric, we worked tiressly to the last minutes to ensure two things. First, a limit-pushing final project that pushed all 3 developers to the edge of their coding comfort zone. And second, we produced an engaging and convoluted product that would be fun for any user. :)

Thank you for your time TAs, have a splendid summer.
