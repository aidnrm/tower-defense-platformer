# CS120: Final Project
## Team Members:
 - Ty Allembert
 - Nate Lalor
 - Aiden McCormack

## Project Summary:
We created an enriching dessert-themed game which we modeled after tower defense, Mario, and Fortnite. 

## Concept Description:
Combining all the previous modules, we were able to build upon a semester of learning to produce an engaging and interactive game that provides the user with long-lasting fun! We worked off a foundation of many concepts, including everything from inheritance & polymorphism in module 2, to the drawing and timers providing graphics from module 4. We outline further within the code, but as a whole we worked hard to efficiently integrate many aspects from throughout the class into our final product. 

## Operating Systems:
We have designed the gaming using simple graphics via C++. That being said, it is combatible for many different operating systems.

## Necessary Installations:
There are no necessary installations required. To reiderate, everything is via C++.

## Citations:
All the code is ours, besides the general shape classes that Lisa used throughout Module 4. This includes the shape class, rect class, circle class, and quad class, which you can find here: https://github.com/uvmcs120s2022/M4GP-Runner and https://github.com/uvmcs120s2022/Graphics-Jeopardy.
